# EthereumSplitwise
Decentralized system to track debit and credit - a blockchain version of Splitwise. Decentralized way to track who owes what to who,
so that no trusted third party has to be relied upon. It will be efficient: it won't cost an exorbitant amount of gas to store
this data. No value will get transferred 'on the blockchain' using this app; the only ether involved will be for gas.
As part of this, a user interface will also be built, which computes useful information for the user and allows non-programmers to use the DApp.

# Built With
 - Javascript - client running locally in web browser
 - web3.js - Ethereum Javascript API 
 - Solidity - smart contract
